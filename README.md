MongoDB Script.py is the main program that I will enhance.  
Python Practice is just a text file that I use as a scratch pad for pieces of code that I don't want to lose or will try later.  
PythonCRUD.py is only the CRUD functions and does not contain the RESTful API service.  I have this as a template incase I need to fix anything within the main program.
